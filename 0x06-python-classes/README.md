Project Name
0x06. Python - Classes and Objects
Requirements
Python Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using python3 (version 3.8.5).
All your files should end with a new line.
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3.
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*).
All your files must be executable.
The main.py files are used to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo.
The length of your files will be tested using wc.
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)').
All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)').
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)').
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified).
